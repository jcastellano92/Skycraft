# Skycraft feature guide

How each part of Skyrim is reproduced. **[Core]** means the custom Skycraft Core mod; anything else names the
third-party mod that provides it.

## You start as a nobody

* **Race selection** [Core]: on first join, pick one of the ten races (Nord, Imperial, Breton, Redguard, High Elf,
  Wood Elf, Dark Elf, Orc, Khajiit, Argonian). Each comes with Skyrim's starting skill bonuses (+10 to one skill,
  +5 to five others), passives (frost, fire, poison or magic resistance, extra Magicka, claws, water breathing) and a
  once-a-day greater power on **H**.
* **Digging is earned** [Core]: you can mine ore veins (pickaxe only) and chop trees (axe only), but terrain can't be
  dug until you unlock Mining perks:
  * **Excavator** (Mining 10): dirt, sand, gravel, clay and snow.
  * **Stonebreaker** (Mining 30): stone and deepslate.
  * **Deep Delver** (Mining 75): obsidian and end stone.

  Blocks you placed yourself are always breakable. `restrictDigging` in `config/skycraft-common.toml` turns this off.

## Skills, leveling and perks [Core]

* **22 skills.** Skyrim's 18 (One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archery, Block, Heavy Armor, Smithing, Destruction,
  Restoration, Alteration, Conjuration, Illusion, Enchanting, Light Armor, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech,
  Alchemy) plus four life skills: Mining, Woodcutting, Fishing and Hunting.
* **Skills improve by use.** Mining ore raises Mining; hitting with a sword raises One-Handed; blocking raises Block,
  and so on. A skill meter pops up as you gain XP, and "Mining increased to 23" shows when the skill levels up.
* **Skyrim's formulas.** XP per skill level is `mult × level^1.95 + offset`. Each skill increase gives character XP
  equal to the new skill level. Going from level L to L+1 takes `(L + 3) × 25` character XP.
* **Level up.** Each character level gives +10 Health, Magicka or Stamina (your choice) and one perk point.
* **Look to the heavens.** Press **K** for a starfield of 22 constellations with 196 perks; scroll or use the arrow
  keys to rotate between them.
* **Legendary skills.** A skill at 100 can be reset to 15 to refund its perks.
* **Training.** Pay trainers (villagers by profession) to raise a skill, up to 5 times per level.
* **Skill books.** Reading one for the first time raises its skill by 1.

## Health, Magicka, Stamina [Core]

* Skyrim pools and HUD bars: Magicka on the left, Health in the center, Stamina on the right. The bars fade out when
  full.
* **Stamina:**
  * Sprinting drains it; at 0 you can't sprint until it recovers.
  * Power attacks and blocking cost stamina.
  * It regenerates after a short pause.
* **Magicka** pays for spells and regenerates more slowly in combat.
* **Health:** vanilla regeneration is replaced by Skyrim-style regeneration, which almost stops in combat.
* **Hunger:** with Skyrim hunger on, food never drains; eating heals and restores stamina.

## Combat [Core + Better Combat]

* **Weapon families.** Daggers, swords, war axes and maces (One-Handed); greatswords, battleaxes and warhammers
  (Two-Handed); bows (Archery). Each family has its own perks:
  * axes cause bleeding
  * maces crush through armor
  * swords and greatswords score critical hits
* **Power attacks.** Hold **Left Alt** while swinging, or attack while sprinting. They cost stamina, deal 1.5×
  damage (1.75× two-handed) and stagger.
* **Blocking.**
  * Hold **V** to block with a weapon (30–70% less damage, costs stamina).
  * Shields block Skyrim-style: they reduce damage rather than nullify it, and Block perks add knockback, bash
    damage, arrow deflection and disarming.
* **Sneak attacks** against unaware targets:
  * 3× damage (6× with Backstab)
  * bows 2× (3× with Deadly Aim)
  * daggers up to 15× with Assassin's Blade

  Crouching makes you harder to detect, and the HUD shows the sneak eye (HIDDEN / DETECTED).
* **Armor skills.** Heavy and Light Armor add protection as they level. Heavy armor slows you down until you take
  Conditioning.

## Magic

* **Spells are learned from spell tomes.** You find them in dungeons and buy them from court wizards (librarians).
  Read a tome to learn its spell for good.
* **Schools and casting.** Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Conjuration and Illusion, in Novice through Master
  tiers.
  * Fire-and-forget spells: press **R** (or right-click with an empty hand).
  * Concentration spells: hold **R**.
* **Costs** follow Skyrim's formula, so higher skill and school perks make spells cheaper.
* **Magic menu** on **G**: equip spells and shouts.
* **Soul Trap** fills soul gems for enchanting.

## Dragons and the Voice

* **Dragons** circle, breathe fire or frost, land to bite and tail-whip, and attack the world at random once you're
  level 3 or higher.
* **Dragon souls.** Killing one lets everyone nearby absorb its soul.
* **Word Walls.** Ancient Nordic shrines in the mountains teach Words of Power. Spend dragon souls to unlock words,
  then shout with **Z**; hold longer for more words. Shouts include Unrelenting Force, Fire Breath, Frost Breath,
  Whirlwind Sprint, Become Ethereal, Dragonrend, Slow Time and more.

## Enemies and spawning

* **Skyrim enemies:**
  * bandits (melee and archers), bandit chiefs and bandit camps
  * draugr and Draugr Deathlords (bosses that shout)
  * skeevers, trolls and frost trolls
  * giants, which launch you into the sky
  * dragons
  * vanilla mobs reskinned by name as Skyrim creatures (Frostbite Spiders, Hagravens, Forsworn, Cliff Racers…)
* **Leveled enemies.** Enemies scale with your level and earn Skyrim rank names (Bandit Outlaw → Bandit Marauder,
  Restless Draugr → Draugr Scourge…).
* **Day and night spawning.** Bandits roam by day; the undead rise at night and lurk in the dark. Creepers and
  phantoms are gone.
* **Loot bodies.** Slain creatures leave a body you open to loot.

## Towns, cities, dungeons, roads and secrets

* **Towns and cities:** ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village, Towns & Towers, Dungeons & Taverns (inns).
* **Dungeons and ruins:** When Dungeons Arise, Moog's Voyager Structures, Explorify, the YUNG's suite, Terralith and
  Tectonic mountains.
* **Roads** [Core] connect settlements, with signposts and lantern posts. Travelers, Khajiit caravans, guard patrols
  and the occasional bandit ambush walk them.
* **Location discovery** [Core]: "DISCOVERED: Bleakwind Barrow" banners with Skyrim-style names, shown on the
  compass and on the Skyrim map.
* **Per-player loot chests** (Lootr): every player gets their own loot from each dungeon chest.
* **Locked chests** [Core]: Novice to Master locks, opened with the lockpicking minigame.

## People, dialogue, factions and quests

* **Named villagers** with relationships, marriage and dialogue (MCA Reborn).
* **Conversation menu** [Core]: talk to any villager to trade, train, ask for work, join factions or chat.
* **Companions** who follow, travel and fight with you (Villager Recruits).
* **Quests** [Core]:
  * Radiant villager quests and Jarl's bounties (bandit leaders, giants, dragons, legendary monster hunts).
  * The main quest, "The Dragonborn".
  * Quests are shared by your **party**: everyone gets the reward.
  * Press **J** for the journal and **U** for your party.
* **Factions** [Core]: the Companions, the College of Winterhold, the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, the
  Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, with ranks and contracts.

## Crime and punishment [Core]

* **Witnessed crimes** add a bounty in the hold where they happen: theft, pickpocketing, assault and murder.
* **Stolen goods** are flagged. Only fences will buy them.
* **Guards** confront you: pay the bounty, go to jail, persuade, bribe, or resist arrest. A bounty of 1000 or more
  means they kill on sight.
* **Jail** is a cell in a separate dimension. Sleeping in the cell bed serves your sentence; serving time costs you
  skill progress.

## Economy [Core]

* **Septims** (gold coins and purses) go straight to your wallet.
* **Barter menu.** Merchants by profession have their own stock and gold, and restock every two days.
* **Prices** depend on your Speech skill and perks: Haggling, Merchant, Investor, Fence and Master Trader.
* **Ways to make money:** quests, bounties, contracts, selling loot, ore, pelts, firewood and fish, and crafting.

## Smithing, enchanting, alchemy [Core]

* **Skyrim materials.** Ores (corundum, orichalcum, moonstone, malachite, quicksilver, ebony, silver), ingots, hides
  and leather strips.
* **Weapons and armor.** Iron, Steel, Orcish, Dwarven, Elven, Glass, Ebony, Daedric and Dragonbone weapons; heavy
  and light armor sets.
* **Forging.** The blacksmith forge, smelter and tanning rack, gated by smithing perks.
* **Tempering.** The grindstone and armor workbench improve gear from Fine to Legendary.
* **Enchanting.** The Arcane Enchanter: disenchant items to learn their enchantments, then enchant using filled soul
  gems.
* **Alchemy.** Ingredients have four effects each, which you discover by eating them or brewing.

## Survival and the world

* **Fishing** feeds the Fishing skill and its perks; Aquaculture 2 adds fish and gear.
* **Hunting:** pelts, meat and monster hunting.
* **Wait and sleep.** Pick how many hours to wait or sleep (beds work any time). In multiplayer, everyone votes.
  Sleeping grants Well Rested.
* **Music** changes with the situation: exploration, night, town, dungeon, combat, Oblivion, Sovngarde. Replace the
  tracks with a resource pack (see `docs/MUSIC.md`).
* **Oblivion.** The Nether is Oblivion: Deadlands, Daedra and Oblivion Gates.
* **Sovngarde.** The End is Sovngarde, where Alduin awaits.
* **Vampires and werewolves** (Vampirism, Werewolves: Become a Beast) let you transform, with their own skill
  trees.
* **Fast travel & Carriages.** The Skyrim map on **M** takes you to discovered locations and party members. Horse carriages outside hold capitals provide paid travel (20–50 Septims) across all 9 Skyrim holds with companion and horse teleportation.
* **Terrain map.** The integrated Skyrim map on **M** replaces third-party maps, featuring explored terrain and fog of war.
* **Woodcutting & Physics.** Whole trees topple and crumble dynamically with physics into harvestable logs, replanting saplings at the stump.
* **Controllers & Steam Deck.** Full gamepad and Steam Deck support out-of-the-box via Controllable with virtual cursor and dedicated layouts.

## Performance

* **Distant Horizons** renders terrain to the horizon cheaply.
* **Rendering and memory:** Embeddium, Oculus, ModernFix, FerriteCore, Entity Culling, Canary and Memory Leak Fix.
* **Distant terrain generation:** Distant Horizons builds far-off terrain in the background on its own worker threads,
  so no separate pre-generation mod is needed. (Chunky was dropped: it crashes new worlds alongside Distant Horizons 3.)
* **Skycraft's own systems** stay cheap: road paving and NPC traffic run on a per-tick budget and never force chunks
  to load.
